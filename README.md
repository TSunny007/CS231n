# Deep Learning
Deep Learning for computer vision taught Fall 2018 at the University of Utah by Bertron Earnshaw, Vice president of data science at Recursion pharmacuticals. This class and homework directly follows along
[Stanford's CS231n class](http://cs231n.stanford.edu), and all homework files are consolidated into individual jupyter notebook for ease of development and access.

## Homework 1:
This homework goes over the following introductory classifiers:
* [KNN](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/TarunSunkaraneni/CS6955/blob/master/HW1/KNN.ipynb)
* [Linear SVM](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/TarunSunkaraneni/CS6955/blob/master/HW1/SVM.ipynb)
*  [Softmax](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/TarunSunkaraneni/CS6955/blob/master/HW1/Softmax.ipynb)
* [Two-Layer perceptron network](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/TarunSunkaraneni/CS6955/blob/master/HW1/NeuralNet.ipynb)

This homework tests understanding of each classifiers, and requires good understanding of matrix calculus and vectorized code for time efficiency. 

## Homework 2:
This homework goes into depth some [Neural Network concepts](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/TarunSunkaraneni/CS6955/blob/master/HW2/fully_connected_networks.ipynb) such as 
* Multilayer Forward and Backward propagation
* Update rules such as SGD+momentum, RMSProp, Adam, Batch normalization and Dropout
* [Tensorflow](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/TarunSunkaraneni/CS6955/blob/master/HW2/tensorflow.ipynb)
